# CallMeInTwoWeeks
This is the source code for Chiral Software's internal call tracking system. It's old, it's clunky, it's quirky, but it does work. Many things need to be fixed in this. First major priorities would be moving from Spring 5 to Spring Boot. Also switching to Bootstrap. And fixing a bunch of bugs and quirks. But even with the quirks, it's very effective and shows how to implement click-to-dial with Asterisk. Chiral has used this system to track many thousands of calls and win many contracts.
