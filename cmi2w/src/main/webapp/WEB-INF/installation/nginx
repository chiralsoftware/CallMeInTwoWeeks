# Sample nginx configuration for using cmi2w behind an Nginx proxy.
# Use of an Nginx proxy is recommended.
# This assumes that the cmi2w process is running on port 8080.

location ^~ /cmi2w/ {
    proxy_pass http://internal-server.example.com:8080/;
    # The default Spring login page uses a processing URL of /login
    # This can be changed easily within Spring but if we want to just use
    # the default, we have a problem with using proxy that changes the URI.
    # An easy solution to this is to use the Nginx sub_filter like this:
    sub_filter '"/login"' '"/cmi2w/login"';
}
